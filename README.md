# Mushroom
A kaggle project of predicting if a mushroom is edible based on 22 features.

Code. R is R codes to do prediction using decision tree and logistic regression. The dataset used in Code.R--"mushrooms"--comes from Kaggle website with 23 variables (22 features and 1 target variable): https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification

SVM.py is Python codes to predict using support vector machine. The dataset used "mushroom_training" has 22 variables (21 features and 1 target variable). I tuned kernel parameters to maximize the accuracy in prediction. 

Mushroom project report is based on output SVM.py.
