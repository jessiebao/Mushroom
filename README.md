# Mushroom
A kaggle project of predicting if a mushroom is edible based on 22 features.

Code. R is R codes to do prediction using decision tree and logistic regression. The dataset used "mushrooms" comes from Kaggle with 23 variables (22 features and 1 target variable). 

SVM.py is Python codes to predict using support vector machine. The dataset used "mushroom_training" has 22 variables (21 features and 1 target variable). 
Different kernels are tried to maximize the accuracy in prediction. 

Mushroom project report is based on output SVM.py.
